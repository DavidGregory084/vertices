### Acknowledgements

Thanks are due to Alexandru Nedelcu ([@alexandru](https://github.com/alexandru)) for the [Monix](https://github.com/monix/monix) library, which makes writing asynchronous code in Scala an absolute pleasure. Vertices makes extensive use of Monix in wrapping the callback-based code in Vert.x.
